 ## Problem Analysis

The problem is to build a code tutoring app. The app should allow users to learn how to code by providing them with interactive tutorials and exercises. The app should also allow users to connect with other users for help and support.

## Design

The app will be built using a Flask web framework. The following HTML files will be needed for the application:

* `index.html`: This will be the main page of the application. It will contain a list of all the tutorials and exercises available.
* `tutorial.html`: This will be the page that displays a single tutorial. It will contain the tutorial content, as well as a form for users to submit questions.
* `exercise.html`: This will be the page that displays a single exercise. It will contain the exercise content, as well as a form for users to submit their answers.
* `profile.html`: This will be the page that displays a user's profile. It will contain the user's name, email address, and a list of the tutorials and exercises they have completed.

The following routes will be needed for the application:

* `/`: This will be the route for the main page of the application.
* `/tutorial/<int:tutorial_id>`: This will be the route for a single tutorial.
* `/exercise/<int:exercise_id>`: This will be the route for a single exercise.
* `/profile`: This will be the route for a user's profile.

## Implementation

The following code can be used to implement the application:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/tutorial/<int:tutorial_id>')
def tutorial(tutorial_id):
    return render_template('tutorial.html', tutorial_id=tutorial_id)

@app.route('/exercise/<int:exercise_id>')
def exercise(exercise_id):
    return render_template('exercise.html', exercise_id=exercise_id)

@app.route('/profile')
def profile():
    return render_template('profile.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

## Testing

The application can be tested by running the following command:

```
python app.py
```

The application can then be accessed by visiting the following URL:

```
http://localhost:5000
```
